This application is meant to offer guidance on the assembly of various Spring framework components.

It simulates an applicatoin that lets users search for hotels and then book them online. In so doing, it exercises core spring, the spring web stack, spring integration, gemfire, rabbitmq, jpa 2, and more.

To run it, you need to install a few prerequisites:
 - rabbitmq-server
 - git clone and then build (mvn clean install) the spring integration amqp adapter in the sandbox (http://git.springsource.org/spring-integration/sandbox)
 - a mail server. At the moment, the application uses a simple mail server installed locally called Apache James. You may use this in your own testing, if you'd like.
   to get started:
   -- download Apache James 2.3.2 (NOT 3.0) from the website
   -- unzip it
   -- run the shell script in the bin folder (it binds to the standard email ports, and so will require elevated priveleges to work: sudo ./run.sh, for example).
   -- then telnet into the admin shell and issue commands like the following:

jlong@studio:~$ telnet localhost 4555
Trying ::1...
Connected to localhost.localdomain.

 - the H2 database needs to be installed and running. http://www.h2database.com/html/main.html. Download it, unzip it and run the bin/run.sh folder. It'll make a console available at http://127.0.1.1:8082/. once the admin console's up, setup the staging data using the import.sql script in the source tree. just run it.
 - these emails will work well in testing. to change the test server for email, modify ds.standalone.properties in the application's source tree, to test emails going to this address, i recommend Thunderbird. Host: localhost, password: 12345, user: josh (this email is configured in the CUSTOMERS table for each user. Change as appropriate and ensure a user is added to the Apache James mail server.
 - Tomcat or tcServer or a suitable Servlet engine. Download any of these options at the appropriate location and deploy the .war generated by this application to the container.
